The draw Groundtrack code in this folder produces a drawing of a Molniya Orbits groundtrack on a map of the earth. 
It utilizes the professor Dan Erwin's code to produce a drawing of the Earth map and to find the Earth Centered Earth Fixed position vector.
The code and functuon to calculate the longitude values and draw the groundtrack is credited to myself.
